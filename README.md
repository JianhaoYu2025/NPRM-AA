# Emotion Dysregulation as a Transdiagnostic Marker in Adolescent Mental Health

This repository contains the research project: **Emotion Dysregulation as a Transdiagnostic Marker in Adolescent Mental Health: A Psycho-Social Risk Interaction Model with EEG-Based Prediction**.

## Project Overview

Adolescent violent crime presents a significant public health challenge worldwide. Traditional approaches often fail to account for the complex interplay between psychological, environmental, and relational factors. In this study, we propose a novel integrative framework combining psychological insights, environmental research, and digital public health tools to better understand and predict adolescent aggression.

## Key Components

### 1. Psycho-Social Risk Interaction Model (PRIM)

- PRIM models the interaction between:
  - **Psychological vulnerabilities**: impulsivity, aggression, emotional dysregulation.
  - **Environmental stressors**: socioeconomic pressures, community violence.
  - **Relational influences**: peer networks, family dynamics.
- Provides a holistic framework to capture latent variables and dynamic interactions that drive adolescent violent behavior.

### 2. EEG-Based Emotion Analysis

- Utilizes EEG (electroencephalography) signals to monitor and analyze emotional dysregulation in real-time.
- Enables objective assessment of emotional states linked to aggression.

### 3. Targeted Intervention and Risk Reduction Strategy (TIRRS)

- Translates PRIM insights into adaptive, personalized interventions.
- Dynamically adjusts interventions based on real-time data and resource availability.
- Supports timely and effective public health response.

## Experimental Results

- **Prediction Accuracy**: Achieved 87.5% accuracy in predicting violent tendencies â€” a 21.3% improvement over traditional statistical models (average 66.2%).
- **Intervention Success Rate**: Improved by 18.7% compared to standard counseling-based approaches.

These results highlight the potential for scal
